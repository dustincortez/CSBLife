Reaction Paper 4

Guide Questions and Reflection for Karilyo:

1. What can you do to prevent what happened in the 2nd part of the story?

	Every person can prevent what happened in the second part by respcting the environment and the people that surround
him/her. Prevention will still start within the person that will do that.


2. How does it affect you as part of the Lasallian community ?

	It affects me very much because it tackles about the attitude shown by the people around. Lassalian students can
also be the cause of the destruction because of the trash/ garbages that were thrown not in the proper attitude.


3. Give at least 2 Benildean Core Values shown on the production 

	We must do all the things that we can do, making our garbage creative to others, for example, recycling our trash
and also caring for one's rights.


4. How can you share these values to others?

	By being a model to them, planting plants as a start of the move. Helping people how to stop the pollution roaming
around our environment. Teaching them how to throw their trash properly.


5. Give your own personal insights about the play.

	I can rate the play a perfect ten because the message of the play is so useful to others or to everyone who doesn't
know how to help our mother earth from those pollution. It must be shared to everyone, not only to the Benildean community,
but also outside the campus.
