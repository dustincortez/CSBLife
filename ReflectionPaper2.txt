Frosh Solidarity Night

	The Frosh Solidarity Night for me is the first ever event that I felt the culture shock! It was the first ever
event thet opened my two eyes from the lonely side and to transform to a energizng and more enjoyable life because it let
me feel that I am not alone that time and they are always at my side to guide me. I learn that even though I am alone at
first, I can assure that I can find new friends outside the environment where I grew up by making these things a big challenge to me. It help myself in doing the things I want to do in order to becmome truly free from my highschool life. It
just lest me show that I can stand on my own, using my feet, I can defend or I can use my freewil in choosing friends.
