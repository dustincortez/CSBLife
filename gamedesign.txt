"How to develop RPG Damage Formulas?"

	It became interesting topic for me because we all know that most of the games use damage stats to identify the strength of the players who are playing a specific game like Final Fantasy X, RPG games, etc. 

	They say that when you formulate a formula, math subject specifically Algebra and pre-Calculus is the most important things or factors in creating a formula because all of the formulas need equations and solutions just to end up to an excellent result. They say that it is like using linear eqauations, logarithmic method in doing stats especially in damage stats becaus all of them needs MATH.

	It is like when you want the value to grow at a constant rate, youu may use a linear function. If you want the value to grow slow at first, but fast later, you may use a polynomial or exponential function. If you want the value to grow fast at first, and slow down later you may use an nth-root or logarithmic function. If you want the value to grow slowly at first, speed up towards the middle, then slow down at the end you may use a sigmoid curve, such as atan or the logistic function. If you want the value to oscillate, you may use a sin or some other wave.

	It only shows that all of the parts of the gaming software and industry are compose of math fromula and math thingy such as the linear equation, logarithmis function andd the likes. Math can affect the growth and the development of the gaming formulas when ssome calculations get wrong and it will surely affect the development of the economic factors of the gaming industry.
