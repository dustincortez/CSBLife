Frosh Orientation Program

	I can rate my Frosh Orientation Program by giving them a perfect 10 pts because even though all the GDD students 
are inside the ARG Theater, that is still to be consider as a brilliant idea for us because we can have a chance to know
all of them for friendships and because we are all batchmates who can help each other.

	At first, I was so confident because I can feel that I can make new friends in DLS-CSB easily because all i want to do and the thing that I set in my mind is that I need to be brave ans strong so that I will not be at the bottom but that was before I enter the theater wherein we were assigned. But as soon as I entered the theater, I was so shocked of the culture because I am entering a place that is consists of frosh students an I feel I am at the bottom right away because I feel small when I saw them. But then, I need to be strong.

	I felt great and refreshed when I saw my highschool classmates because I can see that even though I am new in this college, I know that I am not alone and there are people that can help me inside. But still after the orientation, I felt that I was not alone because my blockmates are nice and I think they are fun to be with.
