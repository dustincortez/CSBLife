SPRINGBOARD

*Have you ever failed an exam? What were the reasons for failing.

     = Yes. I've already failed a quiz because I experienced mental block and lack of focus on that subject when I'm reviewing. I have problems in sources because of the missing notes and acttivity worksheets.

*For those who haven't failed an exam, what was your highest score in exam? What do you think made you reach the top?

     = I don't have an answer to his queston because I've failed some quizzes.

*How was your first experience of CSB Midterm Examinations? Knowing what you know now, what would have you done differently? What are you going to do again for the CSB Finals?

     = My experience to my first CSB Midterm Examination is so unexpected because what am I expecting is a common exam wherein there were questions that will be answered by either multiple choice or identifications, but what I have seen is that the exam is composed of essays wherein your thoughts and opinions are the important factors to pass that exam. For me, even if I am shocked with the exam that was given to us, I will still study the way how I do because I cannot assure to myself that, that kind of exam will be the same as the exam in finals that will be given to us, everything has surprises. I will still study hard because I believe that even though the next exam which is the finals will be the same as the midterm exam, everything is still important to me because in those lessons that I study I can surely adapt ideas on how will I pass every stage. Experience is the most important factor of accomplishing goals.
