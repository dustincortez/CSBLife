          In my highschool life, most of my experiences were good because I can communicate with new friends, ask help to everyone because they all know who am I and they believe to me. But now in college, I must do everything in order to achieve my goals and wishes in my life. In this college life, my new role is to do my best so that I can be the best person that I can be and to return my thank you to my parents to all that they have done to me since the start of my education.

          My new routines now in college are more in manage than in high school because in my course, every second is important that no matter what happen, you must finish what is assigned to you because not only your grades can be affect by your "Filipino-time" but also the people around you because some of them cannot move without your presence because it is a groupwork. I must have time management to accomplish all my commitments to everyone.

          For my new relationships, I must have contact to each other in the means of being sociable to everyone because these people are the ones who will be with you until the 3 years and 1 term of my life in De La Salle - College of Saint Benilde will end but my alumni spirit of being a Benildean will not end because this school serves as my new alma mater in college.

          And lastly, for my new roles, I need to be more competent inside the college life because in that kind of school, I will find new faces and attitudes that I am not comfortable at because you cannot find easy friends that have my expectations like the friends that I can be with my 3 years and 1 term of living in De La Salle - College of Saint Benilde. Be more responsible enough to take those responsibilities that will be entrusted or that will be assigned to me because it will surely complete my college life and let me grow from a shy person that cannot walk with my own feet to a more competent person that can beat those executives in the outside world.
