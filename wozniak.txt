"Want to Remember Everything You'll Ever Learn? Surrender to This Algorithm"


How can I apply wozniak's system for myself and for this course?

	Just follow the studying habits that wozniak instructed because according to my observation, that strategy wherein
you can study on the first day, then on the third day, then on the tenth day, so on and so forth. It can help me especially 
when I'm in the process of learning a new lesson and gaining new knowledge that was assigned to us for us to absorb the
importance of the said topic. We must not terrorized our self in memorizing always because the most important thing that
can help us in studying is by separating understanding from memorizing the facts. Instead of memorizing a bunch of words
or statements, you must first need to learn how to understand it because it will sureley help you in doing what is needed.
It may also let us learn on how we can use it to our everyday living not only to our course but also to our learning 
ouside the environment because I belive that everything that surrounds us even the people who surrounds us can be also the
guide to our success and in absorbing the knowledge that was stated to us.
