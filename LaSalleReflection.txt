"I will always look upon the work of my salvation, and the foundation and government of our community, as the work of God; hence I will abandon the care of both to him, acting only through his orders; I will often consider myself as an instrument which is of no use except in the hands of the workman. Hence I must await the orders of Providence before acting, and be careful to accomplish them when known."

          St. Jean Baptist de La Salle want that all of his works, foundations, or even the government he wants to implement must be according to the will of God whom he put his heart. St. Jean Baptist de La sale will do anything according to what will God will say to him even though he has to leave or abandon one or both of his important belongings or even something that he cherish almost of his whole life. He also wants to me a role model to everyone especially for those people who is abandoned by their own luck. He also wants to be the face of the poor people who wants to continue their studies until they will finish their studies. But then, St. Jean Baptist de La Salle still wants to connect or to base all of his plans and works in accordance if the will of God because he believes that only God who knows what is the right thing for His people and what will contribute more than they need.
