"I will always look upon the work of my salvation, and the foundation and government of our community, as the work of God; hence I will abandon the care of both to him, acting only through his orders; I will often consider myself as an instrument which is of no use except in the hands of the workman. Hence I must await the orders of Providence before acting, and be careful to accomplish them when known."

          St. Jean Baptist de La Salle want that all of his works, foundations, or even the government he wants to implement must be according to the will of God whom he put his heart.
